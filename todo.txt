todo insert hook calls at the proper places
  * find way to pause stuff until hook completes

todo see if settings are blown: need to call the action itself to find the pagination of the data, and size
  * check tree for depth
  * create way to back off by changing the active times

todo Have way for action to insert new subtrees to things at any time (only ancestors can do that)

todo Figure out how to do direct calls, and not just callbacks

todo abstract ownership of hooks and settings
