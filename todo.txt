todo things add wait_until timestamp on things, when it is set into waiting, make cron job to wake it up
 (select expired set to pending, and null out the wait_unti)

todo hook callbacks get a new function /data return called wait timeout, if provided, will put the thing into wait

todo make sure the callbacks will stop the thing and other hooks if set to fail, and will set the thing to wait if the new wait timeout used
